 # Job Placement Prediction Model

This is a web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether a person will be placed in a job based on certain input features. The model uses machine learning and is trained on a dataset of past job placements.

## Features
- Predicts job placement chances based on user input.
- User-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit.
- Allows users to input their features via a text input field.
- Provides a result message indicating if the person is likely to be placed or not.

## Prerequisites

This project requires Python and the following libraries:

- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pillow (for image processing)
- Pickle (for loading the model)

You can install the dependencies using `pip` or `conda`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tusharmjadhav15/Job_Placement_prediction_model.git
   cd Job_Placement_prediction_model

conda create --name jobplacementenv python=3.8
conda activate jobplacementenv


conda install -c conda-forge streamlit scikit-learn pillow numpy

streamlit run jobapp.py


### 5. **Usage**
Explain how to use the web app, including how to provide input and interpret the output.

## Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:8501`.
2. Input the required features in the provided text field. The features should be entered in a comma-separated format (e.g., `feature1, feature2, feature3, ...`).
3. Click "Submit" to receive a prediction from the model.
4. The model will predict whether the person is likely to be placed in a job or not.

## Model Details

The model used in this app is a machine learning classifier trained on job placement data. The model expects a fixed number of features. The input features should match the number and order of the features the model was trained with.

- **Input**: A list of numerical features (e.g., academic performance, skills, etc.)
- **Output**: A binary result where `1` means the person is placed, and `0` means they are not placed.
